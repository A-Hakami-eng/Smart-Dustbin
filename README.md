# Smart Dustbin using Arduino

An IoT-based smart dustbin system designed to improve waste management in public and private spaces. This project was developed as a graduation project by a team of students from Umm Al-Qura University.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Dustbin uses an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect user presence and open the lid automatically. This ensures hygienic and contactless trash disposal. The system is controlled by an Arduino Uno and written in C++ using the Arduino IDE.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a prototype for an automatic trash bin.
- Detect the presence of a person and open/close the lid accordingly.
- Contribute to a cleaner and smarter urban environment.

## 🔧 Components Used

| Component        | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno      | Main controller board                |
| HC-SR04 Sensor   | Measures distance to detect presence |
| Servo Motor (MG996R) | Opens and closes bin lid         |
| Breadboard & Wires | Circuit setup                      |
| Power Supply     | 5V to 12V                            |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor detects motion/hand within a set range.
2. When a hand is detected, the Arduino triggers the servo motor.
3. The servo motor rotates the lid open.
4. After a delay, the lid automatically closes.
